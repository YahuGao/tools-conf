C-h C-h : help
C-x k : kill buffer

C-x 0 : close the active window
C-x 1 : close all windows except the active window
C-x 2 : split the active window vertically into two horizontal windows
C-x 3 : split the active window horizontally into two vertical windows
C-x o : change active window to next window

C-x C-f : open file
C-x C-s : save file
C-x C-w : save file as

C-space : set region mark
C-w : kill region (the kill like cut in GUI)
C-k : kill region between point and end of current line
M-w : kill region without deleting
C-y : yank region from kill ring
M-y : move to previous item in the kill ring
M-Y : move to next item in the kill ring

C-_ :  undo(the same with C-x u)
C-s : search forwards
C-r : search backwards
M-% : query replace (‘space’ to replace, ‘n’ to skip, ‘!’ to replace all)
M-q : wrap text

Add el-get for emacs without basic setup.
**** INSTALL METHOD ****
;; So the idea is that you copy/paste this code into your *scratch* buffer,
;; hit C-j, and you have a working el-get.
(url-retrieve
 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitri/el-get/master/el-get-install.el"
 (lambda (s)
   (goto-char (point-max))
   (eval-print-last-sexp)))
**** INSTALL METHOD ****
For details reference: https://github.com/dimitri/el-get

;; Org-mode 可以列出提高，并使用tab键进行展开和关闭
C-c C-t 将一个条目转换成一条代办事件

C-h C-f find-function
C-h C-v find-variable
C-h C-k find-function-on-key

M-< move to top of the buffer
M-> move to end of the buffer
